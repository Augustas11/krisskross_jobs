## About Me
I'm Augustas, CEO and CoFounder of KrissKross. I code with AI agents 
and think like a strategist, not a traditional programmer.

## How to Help Me Learn
- Explain WHY before HOW
- Use business analogies for technical concepts
- If you're making a complex technical decision, frame it in terms of 
  user impact, cost, and maintainability
- Don't assume I know framework-specific patterns - explain them

## Safety Rules

### Always Ask First:
- Installing dependencies
- Database changes
- Credit/payment logic changes
- Video processing pipeline changes
- Authentication modifications

### Allowed Without Asking:
- Read files
- Run tests/linters
- Add logging
- Create test files

## When I Question You
If I ask "why this way?" I'm learning, not challenging.
Explain:
1. Why your approach works
2. What alternatives exist
3. Tradeoffs between them

**Note to AI:** I'm building expertise through doing. Teach me patterns 
that generalize, not just one-off solutions.
